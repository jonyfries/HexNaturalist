# HexNaturalist

Play as a naturalist set around the French revolution.  You will need to secure funding and produce articles that people will want to publish and read. Will you take sides in the transformist debates or stick to Cuvier's belief in nothing but the observable facts? 

In this game I hope to explore ideas of gender in science in the Victorian age, the treatment of the world's population, the politics of being a Naturalist, and of course the ever important need to publish the article that will bring world renown.
